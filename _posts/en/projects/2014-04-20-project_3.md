Together we dance and create a space without exclusion and intolerance!
The dance project “**Voguing - Against Exclusion and Intolerance**” is enabled through the cooperation of IMPROPER WALLS, Karin Cheng, GB*10 and *pin*.
The project starts with an informational kickoff-event at the IMPROPER WALLS gallery on the 30th of September 2016. Subsequently a dance group, consisting of members of the cooperation partners and persons with experiences of displacement, living in residential facilities in the 10th district, will attend a semester course (4.10.2016 - 31.01.2017) and learn how to “vogue” from dancer Karin Cheng in the facilities of the GB*10.
To conclude the project, IMPROPER WALLS and *pin* will host a “Finissage” to get together, reflect, dance and perform for friends and families.

Goals of this project are:

* To create a space without exclusion and intolerance
* To strengthen own and collective identities
* To encourage trust and feelings of security
* To encourage moments, where body and mind are the focus outside of daily routines, responsibilities or obligations as well as worries or social burden
* To dance!
