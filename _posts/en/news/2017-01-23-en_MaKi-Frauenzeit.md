We are very happy to announce that the project 'Maki-Frauenzeit' will be continued from February 2018 onwards. New dates will be announced at the end of next week. The meetings will be continued to be held at [KO-Alte Burse](https://www.ko-alteburse.at/), Sonnenfelsgasse 19.

Of course all offers Dancing, especially Voguing, is conducive to strengthening our identities and to deconstruct intolerance and exclusion. A group of 16 people will come together (consisting of members of Improper Walls and *pin* and persons with experiences of displacement, living in the 10th district) and take Voguing classes during the whole upcoming semester (Oct 4th 2016 - Jan 31st 2017), conducted by dance teacher Karyin Cheng, in order to strengthen own and collective identity, within a secure space without intolerance and exclusion. The dancing lessons as well as preparation for a final performance are **free of charge** for the participants.

At the end of the semester Improper Walls and *pin* will host a “Finissage” to get together, reflect, dance and perform for friends and families.  

**Where**: KO-Alte Burse, Sonnenfelsgasse 19, 1010 Vienna  
**When**: Tuesday, March 14th 2017 - June 6th 2017, 6:00pm-8:00pm  
**Entry**: free of charge, only with pre-registration
