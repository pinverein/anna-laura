After the info evening, the **Voguing dancing class** will start on the 4th of October 2016.  and following that the classes will continue every Tuesday from 18:30 to 20:00 at the premises of the GB*10, Quellenstraße 149.

Dancing, especially Voguing, is conducive to strengthening our identities and to deconstruct intolerance and exclusion. A group of 16 people will come together (consisting of members of Improper Walls and *pin* and persons with experiences of displacement, living in the 10th district) and take Voguing classes during the whole upcoming semester (Oct 4th 2016 - Jan 31st 2017), conducted by dance teacher Karin Cheng, in order to strengthen own and collective identity, within a secure space without intolerance and exclusion. The dancing lessons as well as preparation for a final performance are **free of charge** for the participants.

At the end of the semester Improper Walls and *pin* will host a “Finissage” to get together, reflect, dance and perform for friends and families.

**When**: Tuesday, Oct 4th 2016 - Jan 31st 2017, 6:30pm-8:00pm
