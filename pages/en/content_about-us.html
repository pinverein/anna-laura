        <div class="lead-text">

          We understand participation to mean active co-determination and participation in decision-making processes. This includes the contribution of ideas as well as the participation in projects, events and dialogue. One of our objectives is to encourage the cooperation of individuals, associations, organizations and institutions. We thereby  put focus on the attempt to continually speak to each other instead of for others.

          For <em>pin</em>, integration, especially sustainable integration, stands for a dynamic, long-lasting and very differentiated process of growing together. This very process must be ensured by promoting the following foundational principles:

          <ul class='styled-list'>

            <li>multidimensional communication</li>
            <li>solidarity and self-reflection</li>

        <div class="lead-text">

          We take continuous and forward-looking participation and networking as essential parts of sustainable structural change in society as a whole. Building a network, cooperating with organisations as well as individuals is one of <em>pin</em>'s main priorities. With our projects we aim to create long-lasting effects through progressive thinking and action. We are convinced that only through strengthened relationships and the inclusion of a variety of perspectives, can offerings be created for all and great impact be achieved.
