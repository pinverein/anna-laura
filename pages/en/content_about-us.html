      <em>pin – Verein für Partizipation, Integration & Nachhaltigkeit</em>

      (association for participation, integration and sustainability) was founded in December 2015 and is a non-profit organization, which stands up for structural and political change in society as a whole. In this process sustainable integration measures and the support for structurally disadvantaged groups as well as individuals, especially persons with experiences of displacement and escape, have priority. The members of pin are committed to being a part of the local integration network and their aim is to encourage social, economic and cultural integration by applying sustainable strategies – such as  promoting access to the labor market and education as well as  awareness-raising actions.

          We understand participation to mean the active co-determination and participation in decision-making processes. This includes the contribution of ideas as well as the participation in projects, events and dialogue. One of our objectives is to encourage the cooperation with individuals, associations, organization and institutions. Thereby we focus on the attempt to continually speak to each other instead of for others.

          For <em>pin</em> integration, especially sustainable integration stands for a dynamic, long-lasting and very differentiated process of growing together. This very process must be ensured by promoting the following points:

          <ul class='styled-list'>

            <li>multidimensional communication</li>
            <li>solidarity and understanding for the topic escape and migration as well as according and relevant coherences</li>
            <li>“participate and let participate”</li>
            <li>integration in the educational sector and labor market</li>
            <li>equal opportunities and support through information and counseling</li>

        <h2 class="title-text">Sustainability</h2>
        <div class="lead-text">

          We take sustainability to mean the combination of foresight and continuity. With our projects we aim at long-lasting effects and achieving effective problem-solving approaches through forward-looking thinking and action. We are convinced that social and structural changes cannot be achieved overnight, but through continuous work.
